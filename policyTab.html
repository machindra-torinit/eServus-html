			 		<h4>01.</h4>
			 		<p>
			 			Menkes Developments Ltd. and its related and affiliated entities (collectively Menkes) respects the privacy of its customers and those individuals who visit our website. This privacy statement outlines our privacy practices and describes how Menkes may collect and use the information that you provide. For the purposes of this statement, personal information means information about an identifiable individual but does not include information that enables someone to be contacted at their place of business. Correspondingly non-identifiable information means information that is not identifiable to an individual - that is, information that cannot be associated with or traced back to a specific individual.
			 		</p>

			 		<h4>02.</h4>
			 		<p>
			 			Menkes does not collect personal information from this website unless you voluntarily provide such information through on-line registration forms, contest entry forms, questionnaires, surveys or other similar documents. Such personal information may include your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, demographic or household information, your preferences with respect to the type of product that Menkes offers or that you might be interested in.

We may also use personal information collected from you to assist us in developing and customizing our products and services to better meet the demands for our customers. Personal information may also be used for any other purpose permitted by law. However, we will not sell, rent, trade or market personal information that we collect from you to third parties.

This non-identifiable information is used only in the aggregate to help us better understand trends and patterns evolving in the marketplace which will in turn allow us to improve the quality of our website.
